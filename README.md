I developed an Amazon web application that incorporates cart functionality using React for building the user interface and Tailwind CSS for responsive design. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in managing component state with React hooks, handling dynamic data updates for the cart, and applying Tailwind CSS for streamlined, responsive styling. This project also deepened my understanding of component-based architecture and interactive UI development.
